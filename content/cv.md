# Alessio Dionisi

I'm a Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience. I started working in 2013 as a freelancer, now I mainly develop backend services and web applications with Go, CockroachDB, Vue.js and Kubernetes. I'm trying to bring the culture of remote work to the companies I know and work with, sooner or later I'll start writing a blog about this topic.
