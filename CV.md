## Experience

### Kubernetes Engineer @ [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io)

_Mar 2023 - Present_

SIGHUP is an Enterprise Open Source company focused on Kubernetes and Infrastructure automation.

- Developed and maintained the tool "furyctl", enabling the installation and management of the Kubernetes Fury distribution. This tool empowered the solution engineering team to autonomously install and manage Kubernetes clusters.
- Contributed to the Fury project, a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution, ensuring ongoing support and enhancements for the dedicated provisioning tool, furyctl.
- Engaged in an internal project for a client focused on monitoring RBAC permissions in a Kubernetes cluster. This project aimed at understanding the permissions granted to users or groups, distinguishing them from default permissions.

### Site Reliability Engineer @ [ProntoPro](https://www.prontopro.it)

_Nov 2021 - Mar 2023_

ProntoPro is Italy's largest local service marketplace.

I joined the SRE team in November 2021, after working as a Backend SWE for almost 2 years. In total I spent almost 4 years at ProntoPro.

- Migrated Kubernetes clusters from OpenStack to AWS EKS, aligning development and production infrastructure. This transition simplified cluster management and reduced network downtime of the development infrastructure because the OpenStack cluster was shared with another company and not managed by us.
- Ensured Kubernetes versions were up-to-date across all clusters and maintained vigilance on existing vulnerabilities.
- Refactored the architecture to manage the clusters using Helm and Terraform, specifically updating Cilium CNI from an outdated version without any downtime. This facilitated easier and more efficient software updates.
- Overhauled and updated the monitoring stack, empowering developers to independently monitor and create Grafana dashboards. This enabled better understanding of the impact of new feature releases.
- Refactored and updated the CI platform based on Drone, resolving frequent disruptions and blocks in software builds. This action enhanced development and release timelines, streamlining overall productivity.

### Software Engineer @ [ProntoPro](https://www.prontopro.it)

_Jan 2020 - Dec 2021_

- Bootstrapped and led a new project using Go and GraphQL to enable the frontend team to generate SEO pages. This project replaced runtime PHP-generated SEO pages with statically generated pages, which were then served via CDN. This approach significantly enhanced SEO efficiency and performance.
- Actively worked on and maintained the main project developed in PHP and the Symfony framework, collaborated with the team to execute various refactors aimed at boosting performance.
- Successfully migrated parts of the PHP main project to dedicated services rewritten in Go, enhancing the scalability of individual components and accelerating development process.
- Refactored and updated the CI workflows of Go projects managed with Drone and GitHub, speeding up the release processes and development cycles.

### Software Engineer @ [Satispay](https://www.satispay.com)

_Apr 2017 - Dec 2019_

Satispay is a mobile payment platform. When I joined, it had around 150k users, which grew to almost 1 million by December 2019. I was part of the frontend team but I also worked on the infrastructure and backend of some projects.

- Played a key role in developing internal consoles using React, GraphQL, and Node.js, enhancing the customer care team's ability to manage users and gain a clearer understanding of ongoing activities.
- Developed and refactored a service using React and Node.js for online payments, used by external integrators and official plugins provided by Satispay. The refactor improved maintainability and facilitated the addition of new features.
- Created a modular, multi-language website using GatsbyJS, enabling the generation of static pages for effective SEO indexing. I've also integrated the system with a CMS to allow the marketing team to autonomously update content.
- Developed and maintained official e-commerce plugins for WooCommerce, Magento, and PrestaShop, significantly increasing the number of business adopting Satispay as a payment method in their e-commerce platforms.

### Self-employed @ Shinyweb

_Apr 2013 - Apr 2017_

Began my career as a freelancer, providing me with the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects and technologies. My primary focus was on managing Linux servers for companies offering web hosting services.

- Developed a veterinary clinic management system using PHP and Laravel, enabling efficient management of appointments and clinical records. This system was resold as a service to clients by my customer.
- Created a mobile application using React Native for managing deliveries and orders from restaurants and stores, which was then marketed as a service to clients by my customer.
- Deployed and managed OpenStack and Proxmox clusters for a company requiring infrastructure to sell virtual private servers.
